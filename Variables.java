// Here are the most-used primitive types in Java:

// int: An int holds integers, like 4 or -51. It is limited to numbers between -2147483648 and 2147483647, or around 2 billion.
// long: These are for larger integers up to 2^63, or around 2 quintillion.
// boolean: A boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
// double:  Doubles are for floating point numbers like 3.14159265. We will use double rather than float almost exclusively, because they are far more precise.
// char: The char data type is used to store a single character, like '$' or 'A'.
// In addition to the primitive data types, the Java programming language also has object types. Some examples:

// String: Represents a sequence of characters, like a Python string.
// BigInteger: Represents an integer that can be any size at all.
